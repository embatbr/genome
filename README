-- Genome --

This project is a simple (and not realistic) genetic analysis. It defines genomes for different species and genetic codes for their members (based on their specie genome).

Here is an example of a .genome file (it's not identation sensitive, but it improves readability):

---
.genome specie

.gene gene_name
.allele allele_name
...
.allele allele_name
.fenotipe allele_name allele_name "fenotipe return"
...
.fenotipe allele_name allele_name "fenotipe return"

...
.gene gene_name
...
---

And it's commands: genome, gene, allele, fenotipe.
allele_name = '[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*' or '@'


Now, an example of a .code file (also not identation sensitive):

---
.genome specie

.gene gene_name allele_name allele_name
...
.gene gene_name allele_name allele_name
---

And it's commands: genome, gene.
